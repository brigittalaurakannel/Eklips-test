# Eklips test

Frontend test for Eklips

## Used languages and libraries

HTML5, CSS3 (Sass), Javascript (JQuery), Bootstrap, Slick slider (https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/), Fancybox (https://fancyapps.com/).

For compliling Sass into CSS I use Koala app (http://koala-app.com/). I just have to link my project folder to Koala and it automatically compiles CSS to my project on every .scss file save. For writing code and pushing it to Github I use Atom (https://atom.io/), where I have plugins to help make my workflow easy and code visibly understandable.
